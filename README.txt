Hello dear

On the folder "Code" You'll find code of the program.
And on the folder "Executable" You'll find a .jar with dependencies for an execution.

Follow the steps below to run the program (You can see the image execution.png for an example):

1) Open a CMD on a folder of the "java-challenge-bowling-bsl-impl-with-dependencies.jar"
2) Run the command "java -jar java-challenge-bowling-bsl-impl-with-dependencies.jar"
3) Choose if you want to select your file or use the default
4) Observe the results of the execution
